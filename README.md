# Sass-Requirements
Do your best in sass using this lightweight package.


### Using this predefined requirements
If your sass compiler knows how to use npm packages, it's enough to import this package like this:
```scss
@import "sass-requirements";
```
Otherwise add `npm_modules` in `includePaths` (In [node-sass](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-sass))
or `load_paths` (In [official sass](http://sasscss.org/1))
argument of your sass config.
